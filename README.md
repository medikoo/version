# version

## Automatic versioning and CHANGELOG generation for packages that follow [semver](https://semver.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

Created as a workaround for following limitations approached when working with [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version):

- Multiple grouping in changelog [conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog#439](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/439#issuecomment-591749593)
- Ability to list commit authors and link their GitHub profiles [conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog#349](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/349)
